### Built With Python, DashApp, Render, Docker, and DashTools
     

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

App Frame work and Deployment: Create DashApp framework through using DashTools: 
When utilizing DashTools, it will create an app template with a default README.md file that has the below information on how to deploy the app locally on your machine: 
    
Welcome to your [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) App! This is a template for your myapp app.
See the [Dash Documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction) for more information on how to get your app up and running.

Run `src/app.py` and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your browser.
    
DashTools and Render work together since Dashtools seamlessly creates the all the required files for deployment. Here is the Render dashboard snippet where you can choose which commited version of the app to deploy: ![image](https://github.com/cudash/cudash/assets/130943510/0494b624-ee97-42fc-8272-b04b8cf090ce)
and here is the snippet of the generated files that DashTools generates ![image](https://github.com/cudash/cudash/assets/130943510/47d79c83-3aff-483e-8e15-6bd677dd3434)
Ultimately, the free plan in Render was not enough for the task so Gary Kim is hosting on his server and has included the required Docker files to launch the app to this github. 

### Public repository
These are steps that were used to push changes into the public repo:

   ```sh
   git init
   ```
   ```sh
   git add
   ```
   ```sh
   git commit m "a message"
   ```
   ```sh
   git push
   ```
    
### Cloning this Github Repository
